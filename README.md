## Summary

The Star Wars app uses the Star Wars Open API to list and search through all Star Wars characters. This was created in React.

The app is really easy to use. You can either search for a specific character if you know their name (yes, spelling matters) or you can simply navigate through the pages (8 pages in total) by using the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons. The app will give you the name, birthday, height, weight, home planet, and their species.

This app was created to get a little more familiar with use API and dealing with resolving promises. In addition I was able to use the async/await methods for functions to make using the data much simpler.
